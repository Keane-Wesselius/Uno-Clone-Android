# Uno
This project was my first time dipping my feet into creating software as opposed to just writing programs. It was created during college with a team of 5 other students. We have created a clone of the popular card game Uno for Android devices. It was written in Java and the team used Android Studio to develop the software. The game functions completely as specified in the official Uno ruleset and was developed over a quarter and delivered on time.
